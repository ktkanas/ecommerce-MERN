### 1.2 Test Levels

#### 1.2.1 Unit Testing
- **Scope:** Individual React components, utility functions, API endpoints
- **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library, Supertest
- **Coverage Target:** 85% code coverage
- **Execution:** Automated on every commit

#### 1.2.2 Integration Testing
- **Scope:** Component interactions, API integrations, database operations
- **Tools:** Jest, MongoDB Memory Server, Supertest
- **Focus:** Data flow between frontend and backend

#### 1.2.3 System Testing
- **Scope:** End-to-end user workflows, cross-browser compatibility
- **Tools:** Cypress, Selenium WebDriver, BrowserStack
- **Focus:** Complete business scenarios
- **Execution:** Automated + Manual testing

#### 1.2.4 Acceptance Testing
- **Scope:** Business requirement validation, user experience
- **Tools:** Manual testing, user feedback
- **Focus:** Stakeholder approval
- **Execution:** Manual testing with business users
