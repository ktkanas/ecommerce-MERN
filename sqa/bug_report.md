### ðŸ”´ BUG-012: Server Performance Degradation Under Load
**Priority:** P1 - Critical  
**Severity:** Critical  
**Status:** Open  
**Assigned to:** DevOps Team  
**Reporter:** Ahsan Qadir  
**Date Found:** June 24, 2025  

**Environment:** Staging  
**Load Testing Tool:** Artillery.io  

#### Summary
Application becomes completely unresponsive when more than 75 concurrent users access the system, causing 500 server errors and connection timeouts.

#### Steps to Reproduce
1. Set up load testing with Artillery
2. Configure test for 100 virtual users
3. Each user performs: Browse products â†’ Search â†’ Add to cart â†’ Checkout
4. Run test for 5 minutes
5. Monitor server response times and error rates

#### Expected Result
System should handle 1000 concurrent users as per performance requirements with <2% error rate

#### Actual Result
- At 50 users: Response time increases to 5-8 seconds
- At 75 users: Server starts returning 500 errors
- At 80+ users: Complete system unresponsiveness
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Memory usage spikes to 98%

#### Performance Metrics
| Concurrent Users | Avg Response Time | Error Rate | Memory Usage |
|------------------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| 10 | 1.2s | 0% | 45% |
| 25 | 2.1s | 0.5% | 62% |
| 50 | 5.8s | 3% | 78% |
| 75 | 12.3s | 15% | 94% |
| 100 | Timeout | 85% | 98% |

#### Impact Assessment
- **Business Impact:** CRITICAL - Site unusable during peak traffic
- **Revenue Impact:** High - Lost sales during high-traffic periods
- **User Experience:** Severe - Site crashes under normal load
- **Scalability:** Failing to meet basic performance requirements

#### Server Logs Extract
```
[ERROR] 2025-06-24 14:23:15 - Database connection timeout
[ERROR] 2025-06-24 14:23:16 - MongoDB connection pool exhausted
[ERROR] 2025-06-24 14:23:17 - Memory limit exceeded: 2048MB
[FATAL] 2025-06-24 14:23:18 - Application crash: Out of memory
```

#### Root Cause Analysis
- **Database Connections:** MongoDB connection pool limited to 10 connections
- **Memory Leaks:** React components not properly unmounting
- **Inefficient Queries:** N+1 query problem in product listing
- **No Caching:** Database queries not cached, hitting DB for every request
- **Resource Limits:** Server allocated only 2GB RAM, insufficient for load

#### Recommended Solutions
1. **Immediate (24 hours):**
   - Increase MongoDB connection pool to 100 connections
   - Increase server memory to 8GB
   - Implement Redis caching for product queries

2. **Short-term (1 week):**
   - Fix memory leaks in React components
   - Optimize database queries with proper indexing
   - Implement connection pooling

3. **Long-term (1 month):**
   - Implement horizontal scaling with load balancer
   - Move to microservices architecture
   - Implement CDN for static assets

### ðŸŸ  BUG-008: Order History Not Displaying
**Priority:** P2 - High  
**Severity:** High  
**Status:** Open  
**Assigned to:** Backend Team  
**Reporter:** Muhammad Anas 
**Date Found:** September 2, 2024 

#### Summary
Users cannot view their order history despite having completed orders, affecting customer service and user experience.
